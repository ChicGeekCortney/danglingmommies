<h1 class="headings">About</h1>
<p>
  Being a new mother is not an easy task. Many mothers find themselves asking many questions and needing much help. However, Sometimes a person may often wonder are there other mothers like themselves. Mothers who were new to many things, jobs, school and motherhood but often forget about making time for themselves. <br>

  DMSC was founded so that mothers could support one another and share information and resources while promoting self-care. It is so important to have a relationship with people who are also experiencing the same things you are or who have experienced those things that you can relate to. Take a look at our mission statement also located on this page. <br>

  DMSC does many things, from community service events, mommy and me events and lastly, mommy night out events! You can check all of that out on our events page. We can't wait to meet you, see you soon! <br>
