<h2>Alexis N.</h2>
<p>Founder</p>
<p>When I became a new mommy in July of 2016, I was showered with so much love and support from my mommy friends and family that it ultimately inspired me to start a mommy club. Motherhood isnâ€™t easy but the bond a mother shares with her child is unwavering and the most rewarding job. I believe that giving support, encouragement, and building relationships with other like-minded mothers is beneficial through the journey of motherhood. I wanted my mommy club to be a place where mothers could discuss important topics, build relationships, and learn from each other.
I understand that as mothers, life sometimes gets hard, overwhelming, and so busy that self-care becomes less and less of a priority. I want mothers to know that self-care is important and doing things that makes one happy is achievable. Therefore, I founded the Dangling Mommies Social Club and look forward to meeting all new mothers interested in becoming a member!!

  <p>I assist with the business needs of the club and event coordinating. I entered motherhood in May of 2012. Being the first of my friends to have a child, I desired to build relationships with other mothers that could relate to my life. Therefore, I said yes when my friend Alexis, founder of DMSC asked me to join her team. I currently work as an Academic Advisor at Michigan State University and I am pursuing my Masters in the field of Social Work. I am eager to support, encourage, and bond with other mothers. </p>
