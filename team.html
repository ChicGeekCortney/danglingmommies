  <h2>Darcia</h2>
<p>My name is Darcia Miller and I have my Bachelors and Masters in Social Work. I currently work as a case manger for severely mentally ill children and adults. My passion has always been to help others and offer a helping hand when needed. So I was extremely honored when Alexis asked me to join Dangling mommies. Joining Dangling mommies has allowed me to continue to grow in my passion, as well as learn about motherhood from the prospective and experiences of others. I'm so happy to be apart of Dangling mommies and I looked forward to meeting every mommy that joins.</p>
